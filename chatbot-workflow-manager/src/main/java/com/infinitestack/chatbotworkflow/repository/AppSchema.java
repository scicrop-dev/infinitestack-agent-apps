/**
 * The schema every table of this app lives in.
 *
 * <h3>Why a schema of its own</h3>
 * An Agent App writes into the customer's destination database — the same one holding their
 * business tables. Landing four tables in {@code public} puts them in the middle of everything the
 * customer owns: hard to tell apart, easy to trip over on a dump, and impossible to grant or revoke
 * as a unit. A dedicated schema makes "everything the apps created" a single, addressable thing.
 *
 * <h3>Why the SQL is qualified instead of relying on search_path</h3>
 * Setting {@code search_path} on the connection would look tidier, but it is not deterministic
 * here: Postgres accepts a {@code search_path} naming a schema that does not exist yet and silently
 * falls through to the next one. Between the pool opening its first connection and the schema being
 * created, a {@code CREATE TABLE} would land in {@code public} — and nothing would report it.
 * Qualifying every statement removes the ordering question entirely.
